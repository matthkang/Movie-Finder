# Movie-Finder

## Description

Have you ever wanted to watch a movie, but you don’t know what to watch? With today’s plethora of options, picking a movie can prove to be a difficult task. Then allow us to introduce you to Movie Finder! Movie Finder allows users to find a movie that they want to watch based off of a keyword, the movie’s language, what streaming service they have access to, and the genre of the movie. Upon hitting the submit button, users will be presented with up to 4 different options that fit their desired criteria!

Happy Streaming!


## Instalation

This entire project was made in Visual Studio. We ended up using 4 different API's in order to finalize our application. The API's we used were the Movie of the Night API, the Youtube API, the GitHub API and the Unsplash Image API.  

## Usage

The final product looks like this:

 This web application acts as a movie finder for the user. Users have the ability to search for content to watch using four different parameters. These parameters are a keyword, what streaming service you would like to watch on, what language you would like the movie to be, and the genre that you are interested in viewing. Users are then able to conduct a search that will result in 4 different movies being displayed for their choosing. Upon viewing the results, they will be greeted by the movies poster, a description of the movie, a link to the trailer on Youtube, the cast of the movie, what age the movie is rated for, as well as the language of the movie. Search results are saved and can be revisited at any time using the history book icon in the top right hand corner. Users also can navigate to our about us page, where we give a little info on our application, as well as use the GitHub API to link the application to our four different profiles. If you wish to return home at any time, simply click the Movie Finder logo in the top left hand corner to be redirected home.
